## 🚀 Projects

### 🧠 Machine Learning (`ml`)

A collection of projects related to machine learning, categorized by paradigm.

-   **NLP**:
    -   `03_pdf-translator`: A tool to translate text in PDF files using Hugging Face models.
-   **Supervised**:
    -   `02_dl-concrete-classification`: A deep learning project for classifying concrete strength, from an IBM Coursera course.
-   **Unsupervised**:
    -   `01_ga-knapsack-solver`: A Genetic Algorithm implementation to solve the classic knapsack problem.

### 📊 Data Science & Operations Research (`dsc`)

Projects focused on data analysis, visualization, and optimization.

-   `01_spc-charts-steel-plates`: Analysis of steel plates using Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts.
